## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any significant new ideas. This includes things like adding new utilities, creating new at-rules, etc.

If you create a new branch to contributing, make a Draft Pull Requets, even if you haven't finished the implementation yet, to prevent other contributors from making changes that break your implementation, and to keep everyone aware of your progress. After you finish your changes, enable your PR for review and merging.
